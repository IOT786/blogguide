      "description":"Welcome to Android application development! Building Your First App This app will teaches you how to build your first Android app. You will learn how to create an Android project with Android Studio .You will also learn some fundamentals of Android app design, including how to build a simple user interface and handle user input. Before you start, download and install Android Studio. Creating an Android Project This lesson shows you how to create a new Android project with Android Studio and describes some of the flles in the project. 1:- In Android Studio, create a new project: -> If you don’t have a project opened, in the Welcome to Android Studio Window, click Start a new Android Studio project. -> If you have a project opened, select FileNew file > New Project. 2:- In the New Project screen, enter the following values: -> Application Name: My First App -> Company Domain: xyz.com Android Studio fills in the package name and project location for you, but you can edit these if you’d like. 3:- Click N ext. 4:- In the Target Android Devices screen, keep the default values and click Next. The Minimum Required SDK is the earliest version of Android that your app supports, which is indicated by the API level. To support as many devices as possible, you should set this to the lowest version available that allows your app to provide its core feature set. If any feature of your app is possible only on newer versions of Android and it’s not critical to the core feature set, enable that feature only when running on the versions that support it. 5:- In the Add an Activity to Mobile screen, select Empty Activity and click N ext. 6:- In the Customize the Activity screen, keep the default values and click Finish. After some processing, Android Studio opens and displays a Hello World app with default files. You will add functionality to some of these files in the following lessons. Now take a moment to review the most important tiles. First, he sure that the Project window is open (select View > Tool Windows > Project) and the Android View is selected from the drop-down list at the top. app > java > com.examplemyiirstapplication > MainActiVity.java This file appears in Android Studio after the New Project Wizard finishes. It contains the class deiinition for the activity you created earlier. When you build and run the app, the Activity starts and loads the layout file that says Hello World! app > res > layout > activity_main.xml This XML tile deiines the layout of the activity and contains a TeXtVieW element with the text Hello world! . app > manifests > AndroidManifest.xml The manifest iile describes the fundamental characteristics of the app and delines each of its components. You’ll revisit this tile as you follow these lessons and add more components to your app. Gradle Scripts > build.gradle Android Studio uses Gradle to compile and build your app.",

      "description":"In the previous step, you created an Android project that displays Hello World.You can now run the app on a real device or on an emulator. If you don’t have a real device available than Run on an Emulator. Run on a Real Device Set up your device as follows: 1:- Connect your device to your development machine with a USB cable. If you’re developing on Windows, you might need to install the appropriate USB driver for your device. For help installing drivers, see the OEM USB Drivers document. 2:- Enable USB debugging on your device by going to Settings > Developer options. Note: On Android 4.2 and newer, Developer options is hidden by default. To make it available, go to Settings > About phone and tap Build number seven times. Return to the previous screen to find Developer options. Run the app from Android Studio as follows: 1:- In Android Studio, select your project and click Run from the toolbar. 2:- In the Select Deployment Target window, select your device, and click OK. Android Studio installs the app on your connected device and starts it. Run on an Emulator Before you run your app on an emulator, you need to create an Android Virtual Device (AVD) deiinition. An AVD deiinition detines the characteristics of an Android phone, tablet, Android Wear, or Android TV device that you want to simulate in the Android Emulator. Create an AVD Def1nition as follows: 1:- Launch the Android Virtual Device Manager by selecting Tools > Android > AVD Manager, or by clicking the AVD Manager icon in the toolbar. 2:- In the Your Virtual Devices screen, click Create Virtual Device. 3:- In the Select Hardware screen, select a phone device, such as N exus 6, and then click Next. 4:- In the System Image screen, choose the desired system image for the AVD and click N ext. If you don’t have a particular system image installed, you can get it by clicking the download link. 5:- Verify the contiguration settings (for your first AVD, leave all the settings as they are), and then click Finish. Run the app from Android Studio as follows: 1:- In Android Studio, select your project and click Run from the toolbar. 2:- In the Select Deployment Target window, select your emulator and click OK. That’s how you build and run your Android app on the emulator!

      "description":"Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.",
